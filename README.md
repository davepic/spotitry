Spotitry uses the Spotify API to provide the user with various tools for creating and editing playlists. It includes a setlister feature
that works with the Setlist.fm API to allow the user to create a Spotify playlist out of any Setlist.fm setlist by simply pasting the 
Setlist.fm URL of the setlist into the app. It also includes a feature that utilizes the Last.fm API and the Spotify API to determine what 
song is currently being played in Spotify and allow the user to delete that song from a given playlist or save it to their Spotify song 
list. Finally, the app has an upload feature that works with openpyxl to allow the user create a Spotify playlist out of an uploaded excel 
spreadsheet which specifies track names and artists.
